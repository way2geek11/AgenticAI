# Module 3: Indexing Strategies for RAG

## Introduction

Indexing determines how documents are organized and retrieved in a RAG system. The right indexing strategy dramatically impacts retrieval accuracy, speed, and answer quality. This module explores five core approaches using LlamaIndex.

## ⚠️ Two Types of "Indexing" - Don't Confuse Them!

The term "indexing" is overloaded in the RAG ecosystem. Before proceeding, let's distinguish two completely different concepts:

### 1. RAG-Level Indexing (Knowledge Indexing)

**What it is:** How you organize and structure your private data *before* any query happens, so the right context can be retrieved.

**Examples:**
- How documents are chunked (size, overlap, semantics)
- Hierarchical structure (document → section → paragraph)
- Summary indexes vs detail indexes
- Metadata & keyword indexes
- Multiple logical indexes with query routing

**Question it answers:** 👉 *"What knowledge is even retrievable in this system?"*

### 2. DB-Level Indexing (Vector / ANN Indexing)

**What it is:** How a vector database *internally* stores and searches vectors efficiently.

**Examples:**
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- IVF (Inverted File Index)
- PQ (Product Quantization)
- DiskANN

**Question it answers:** 👉 *"How fast can we search the vectors that already exist?"*

### The Key Distinction

| Aspect | RAG-Level Indexing | DB-Level Indexing |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Knowledge organization | Search performance |
| **Who controls it** | You (the developer) | The vector DB |
| **Impact** | What gets retrieved | How fast it's retrieved |
| **This module** | ✅ **Primary focus** | Mentioned but abstracted |

> **This module focuses on RAG-level knowledge indexing** — the higher-level abstraction that determines *what* your system can retrieve. DB-level indexing (HNSW, IVF, etc.) is handled by your vector database and is largely a performance optimization you configure, not design.

## Why LlamaIndex for This Module?

**Important:** For this module, we're using **LlamaIndex** instead of LangChain to demonstrate indexing strategies. Here's why:

### Framework Choice Rationale

Throughout this workshop:
- **Modules 1, 2, 4, 5**: Use LangChain + OpenAI (consistent framework)
- **Module 3 (this one)**: Uses LlamaIndex (specialized for indexing)

**Why switch frameworks?**
1. **LlamaIndex is purpose-built for indexing** - Clean abstractions for different index types
2. **Easier to teach** - Simple API for Vector, Summary, Tree, Keyword indexes
3. **Better demonstrations** - Native support for all indexing patterns we want to show

### Integration with LangChain

Don't worry! LlamaIndex and LangChain work together seamlessly:

```python
# Using LlamaIndex indexes in LangChain pipelines
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Build index with LlamaIndex
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Convert to LangChain retriever
retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=3)

# Use in LangChain chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True
)

# Query as usual
response = qa_chain({"query": "How do I fix auth issues?"})
```

### Key Takeaway

**Different frameworks, same concepts.** Whether you use LangChain or LlamaIndex in production, understanding indexing strategies remains crucial. The patterns you learn here apply universally.

## Understanding Index vs Retrieval

Before diving into strategies, let's clarify a common confusion:

### Index = Storage Structure
**Index** is how you **organize and store** your embedded documents.

Think of it like a library:
- All books (documents) are stored on shelves
- Embedding vectors are stored **flat** in vector storage (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
- The storage itself is typically just a flat array of vectors

```python
# The actual storage is simple
embeddings = [
    [0.23, 0.45, 0.12, ...],  # Doc 1 vector (1536 dims)
    [0.87, 0.34, 0.91, ...],  # Doc 2 vector (1536 dims)
    [0.56, 0.78, 0.23, ...],  # Doc 3 vector (1536 dims)
]
# Stored flat in vector database
```

### Retrieval = Search Logic
**Retrieval** is how you **find and select** relevant documents at query time.

This is where the intelligence lives:
- Vector similarity search (cosine, L2)
- Hierarchical traversal (tree structures)
- Keyword matching
- Hybrid combinations
- Re-ranking
- Filtering by metadata

```python
# The retrieval logic determines HOW to search
vector_retrieval:
    1. Embed query
    2. Compute similarity with all vectors
    3. Return top-K by similarity score
    
tree_retrieval:
    1. Start at root summary
    2. Identify relevant branches
    3. Traverse down to leaf nodes
    4. Return relevant leaves

hybrid_retrieval:
    1. Vector search → candidates A
    2. Keyword search → candidates B
    3. Combine using RRF → final results
```

### The Key Insight

**Storage is flat, retrieval is smart.**

- All these indexing strategies store embeddings in basically the same way (flat vectors)
- The **magic is in the retrieval logic** - how you traverse, filter, and combine results
- Different "indexes" in this module = different **retrieval strategies**, not different storage formats

   Different retrieval logic, same underlying storage
```

### Practical Example

```python
# Same vectors, different retrieval strategies

# Strategy 1: Vector similarity (flat search)
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
vector_engine = vector_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)
# Retrieval: Direct cosine similarity, return top 3

# Strategy 2: Tree hierarchy (structured traversal)  
tree_index = TreeIndex.from_documents(docs)
tree_engine = tree_index.as_query_engine()
# Retrieval: Navigate tree structure, drill down to leaves

# Strategy 3: Keyword matching (no embeddings needed)
keyword_index = KeywordTableIndex.from_documents(docs)
keyword_engine = keyword_index.as_query_engine()
# Retrieval: Extract keywords, match against document keywords

# Same docs, same vectors (where applicable), 
# but DIFFERENT RETRIEVAL LOGIC yields different results!
```

Now you understand: **Indexing strategies are really retrieval strategies.**

## Why Indexing Strategy Matters

### The Challenge
Not all queries need the same retrieval approach:
- **Specific questions**: "What's the API key for X?" → Need exact chunks
- **Broad questions**: "Tell me about authentication" → Need multiple related chunks
- **Exploratory queries**: "What issues are common?" → Need hierarchical browsing

### The Impact
| Bad Indexing | Good Indexing |
|--------------|---------------|
| Returns irrelevant chunks | Finds the right context |
| Misses related information | Connects concepts |
| Slow retrieval | Fast, scalable search |
| High false positives | Precise results |

## Five Indexing Strategies

### 1. Vector Index (Flat Index)

**Description**: Embed all chunks and retrieve by semantic similarity.

**How It Works:**
```
1. Chunk documents → [chunk1, chunk2, ..., chunkN]
2. Embed each chunk → [emb1, emb2, ..., embN]
3. Store in vector database
4. Query: Embed query → Find closest embeddings
```

**Code:**
```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, Document

# Create documents
docs = [Document(text=text, metadata=metadata) for text in texts]

# Create index
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Query
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)
response = query_engine.query("How do I reset my password?")
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple and effective
- ✅ Fast with modern vector DBs
- ✅ Works for 90% of use cases
- ✅ Easy to scale

**Cons:**
- ❌ No hierarchical structure
- ❌ May return fragmented chunks
- ❌ All chunks treated equally

**Best For:**
- General purpose RAG
- Q&A systems
- Semantic search
- Getting started quickly

**When to Use:**
- Default choice for most applications
- You have well-chunked documents
- Queries are specific and focused

**Real-World Use Cases:**
```
✓ Customer support ticket search
  Query: "How do I fix login issues?"
  Finds: "Authentication problems", "SSO failures"

✓ FAQ and documentation search
  Query: "What's the refund policy?"
  Finds: Semantically similar policy documents

✓ Chatbot knowledge base
  Query: "My order hasn't arrived"
  Finds: Shipping delay articles, tracking info

✓ Research paper search
  Query: "Machine learning for fraud detection"
  Finds: Related papers even with different terminology

Scale: Works well up to millions of documents
```

**Parameters:**
```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    similarity_top_k=3,  # Number of chunks to retrieve
    response_mode="compact",  # How to synthesize answer
    streaming=False  # Enable streaming responses
)
```

### 2. Summary Index

**Description**: Store and search through full documents using LLM evaluation.

#### How It Works

Unlike Vector Index which uses embeddings for similarity search, Summary Index stores full documents and uses the LLM to evaluate relevance:

**Storage (No Chunking, No Embeddings):**
```
[Doc 1: Full ticket text] → Stored as-is
[Doc 2: Full ticket text] → Stored as-is
[Doc 3: Full ticket text] → Stored as-is
...all documents stored without modification
```

**Query Process (Linear Scan):**
```
Query: "How do I fix authentication issues?"

Step 1: LLM reads Doc 1 → "Relevant? Yes"
Step 2: LLM reads Doc 2 → "Relevant? No"
Step 3: LLM reads Doc 3 → "Relevant? Yes"
... continues for ALL documents

Step N: Collect relevant docs → [Doc 1, Doc 3, ...]
Step N+1: Synthesize answer from all relevant docs
```

**Why It's Slow:**
```
Complexity: O(n) - must check every document
Each check = LLM call or LLM attention

10 documents:   ~2 seconds
100 documents:  ~20 seconds
1000 documents: ~200 seconds ⚠️ Too slow!
```

**Response Modes:**
```python
# tree_summarize: Hierarchical summarization
# - Summarizes groups of docs, then summarizes summaries
# - Good for comprehensive answers from multiple sources
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")

# compact: Fits as much as possible in one LLM call
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="compact")

# refine: Iteratively refines answer with each doc
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="refine")
```

**Code:**
```python
from llama_index.core import SummaryIndex

# Create index (no embeddings, stores full docs)
index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Query with tree_summarize for comprehensive answers
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    response_mode="tree_summarize"
)
response = query_engine.query("What are common auth issues?")
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Returns full documents (no fragmentation)
- ✅ Good for high-level queries
- ✅ No embeddings needed (optional)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slow for large datasets (O(n) scan)
- ❌ No semantic similarity
- ❌ LLM must process all docs

**Best For:**
- Small document collections (<100 docs)
- High-level summarization
- When you want full documents returned

**When to Use:**
- You have <50 documents
- Documents are naturally scoped (tickets, emails)
- Queries need broad context

**Real-World Use Cases:**
```
✓ Executive report summarization
  Query: "Summarize all customer complaints this week"
  Dataset: 20 complaint emails
  Returns: Comprehensive summary across all docs

✓ Meeting notes analysis
  Query: "What decisions were made about the budget?"
  Dataset: 15 meeting transcripts
  Returns: Full context from relevant meetings

✓ Email thread understanding
  Query: "What was the final agreement?"
  Dataset: 30 emails in a negotiation thread
  Returns: Complete thread context

✓ Small knowledge base Q&A
  Query: "What are our vacation policies?"
  Dataset: 25 HR policy documents
  Returns: Full policy documents, not fragments

Scale: <50 documents (gets slow beyond that)
```

**Performance:**
```
10 documents: ~2 seconds
100 documents: ~20 seconds
1000 documents: ~200 seconds ⚠️ Too slow!
```

### 3. Tree Index (Hierarchical)

**Description:** Build a tree structure from leaf nodes (chunks) to root (summary).

**How It Works:**

```
Root: "Support system overview"
  ├─ Branch: "Authentication issues"
  │   ├─ Leaf: "Password reset error"
  │   └─ Leaf: "SSO login failure"
  └─ Branch: "Performance problems"
      ├─ Leaf: "Database timeout"
      └─ Leaf: "Memory leak"

Query Process:
1. Start at root level
2. Find most relevant branch
3. Drill down to specific leaves
4. Return bottom-up synthesized answer
```

#### How the Tree Is Built (Bottom-Up from Leaf Nodes)

The tree is constructed **bottom-up**. LlamaIndex groups leaf nodes (chunks) into groups of `num_children`, asks the LLM to summarize each group, then repeats the process on the summaries until a single root node remains.

**Example: 8 Leaf Nodes with `num_children=2`**

```
Input chunks: [L1] [L2] [L3] [L4] [L5] [L6] [L7] [L8]

Step 1: Group leaves into pairs (num_children=2)
         LLM summarizes each pair

  [L1] [L2]  →  [S1: summary of L1+L2]
  [L3] [L4]  →  [S2: summary of L3+L4]
  [L5] [L6]  →  [S3: summary of L5+L6]
  [L7] [L8]  →  [S4: summary of L7+L8]

Step 2: Group summaries into pairs (num_children=2)
         LLM summarizes each pair

  [S1] [S2]  →  [S5: summary of S1+S2]
  [S3] [S4]  →  [S6: summary of S3+S4]

Step 3: Group into final root (num_children=2)
         LLM summarizes the pair

  [S5] [S6]  →  [ROOT: summary of S5+S6]

Resulting tree (height = 3):

                    [ROOT]
                   /      \
               [S5]        [S6]
              /    \      /    \
           [S1]  [S2]  [S3]  [S4]
           / \   / \   / \   / \
          L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8

LLM calls to build: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 summarization calls
```

**Same 8 Leaf Nodes with `num_children=4`**

```
Input chunks: [L1] [L2] [L3] [L4] [L5] [L6] [L7] [L8]

Step 1: Group leaves into groups of 4 (num_children=4)
         LLM summarizes each group

  [L1] [L2] [L3] [L4]  →  [S1: summary of L1+L2+L3+L4]
  [L5] [L6] [L7] [L8]  →  [S2: summary of L5+L6+L7+L8]

Step 2: Group into final root (only 2 nodes, fits in one group)
         LLM summarizes

  [S1] [S2]  →  [ROOT: summary of S1+S2]

Resulting tree (height = 2):

                 [ROOT]
                /      \
            [S1]        [S2]
          / | \ \     / | \ \
        L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8

LLM calls to build: 2 + 1 = 3 summarization calls
```

**Impact of `num_children` on Tree Shape:**

```
                    num_children=2          num_children=4
                    ──────────────          ──────────────
Tree height:        log₂(N)                 log₄(N)
                    (tall & narrow)          (short & wide)

Build cost:         More LLM calls          Fewer LLM calls
                    (more summaries)         (fewer summaries)

Summary quality:    Better (smaller groups)  Coarser (larger groups)
                    Each summary focuses     Each summary covers
                    on 2 children            4 children

Query traversal:    More levels to traverse  Fewer levels
                    More LLM decisions       Fewer LLM decisions
                    per query                per query, but more
                                             children to evaluate
                                             at each level

For 1000 leaves:
  num_children=2  → height ≈ 10, ~999 build calls
  num_children=4  → height ≈ 5,  ~333 build calls
  num_children=10 → height ≈ 3,  ~111 build calls
```

#### How Does Grouping Actually Work?

A common misconception is that LlamaIndex groups chunks by **topic similarity**. It doesn't. The grouping is purely **sequential** — chunks are grouped in the order they were inserted (which is typically the order they appear in the document).

```
Document: "Physics Textbook"

After chunking you get these chunks in order:
  Chunk 0: Newton's First Law (inertia)
  Chunk 1: Newton's Second Law (F=ma)
  Chunk 2: Newton's Third Law (action-reaction)
  Chunk 3: Kinetic Energy
  Chunk 4: Potential Energy
  Chunk 5: Conservation of Energy
  Chunk 6: Coulomb's Law
  Chunk 7: Electric Field Strength

With num_children=4, LlamaIndex groups them strictly by position:
  Group 1: [Chunk 0, Chunk 1, Chunk 2, Chunk 3]  ← "Newton's Laws + Kinetic Energy"
  Group 2: [Chunk 4, Chunk 5, Chunk 6, Chunk 7]  ← "Potential/Conservation + Electric Fields"

Notice: Group 1 mixes Newton's Laws with Kinetic Energy
        Group 2 mixes Energy topics with Electromagnetism
        The grouping is NOT semantic — it's just positional
```

**Why does this still work?**

Documents naturally have **locality of topic** — nearby chunks tend to be about related things. A textbook discusses Newton's Laws on consecutive pages, not scattered randomly. So sequential grouping is a reasonable heuristic that works well for most structured documents.

**When it breaks down:**

```
Scenario: You index 3 separate documents concatenated together

  Doc A - Chunk 0: "Authentication overview"
  Doc A - Chunk 1: "Password reset steps"      ← end of Doc A
  Doc B - Chunk 2: "Billing FAQ"               ← start of Doc B (unrelated!)
  Doc B - Chunk 3: "Refund policy"

With num_children=2:
  Group 1: [Chunk 0, Chunk 1]  → Summary: "Authentication topics" ✅ coherent
  Group 2: [Chunk 2, Chunk 3]  → Summary: "Billing topics"       ✅ coherent

With num_children=4:
  Group 1: [Chunk 0, Chunk 1, Chunk 2, Chunk 3]
           → Summary: "Auth and billing topics" ⚠️ mixed, coarser summary
```

**The LLM summary layer compensates:** Even when unrelated chunks land in the same group, the LLM writes a summary that captures what's in the group. At query time, the summary still mentions both topics, so the right branch can still be found. It's less precise, but it doesn't break.

**What the actual LlamaIndex code does (simplified):**

```python
def build_tree_bottom_up(nodes, num_children):
    """
    Groups nodes sequentially, summarizes each group,
    repeats until one root node remains.
    """
    current_level = nodes  # leaf chunks in insertion order

    while len(current_level) > 1:
        next_level = []

        # Walk through nodes sequentially, grab groups of num_children
        for i in range(0, len(current_level), num_children):
            group = current_level[i : i + num_children]

            # Concatenate the text of all nodes in the group
            combined_text = "\n\n".join([node.text for node in group])

            # Ask LLM to summarize the combined text
            summary = llm.summarize(combined_text)

            # Create parent node pointing to these children
            parent = Node(text=summary, children=group)
            next_level.append(parent)

        current_level = next_level  # move one level up

    return current_level[0]  # root node
```

**Key takeaway:** The tree structure is determined entirely by **chunk order + `num_children`**, not by semantic clustering. This is what makes it fast to build — no pairwise similarity computation needed.

#### Tree Index: Detailed Example with Physics Textbook

Let's see how LlamaIndex builds and queries a tree structure using a Physics textbook:

**Input: Physics Textbook Chapters**

```
Chapter 1: Classical Mechanics
  - Section 1.1: Newton's Laws of Motion
    • Page 5: First Law (Inertia)
    • Page 7: Second Law (F=ma)
    • Page 10: Third Law (Action-Reaction)
  - Section 1.2: Energy and Work
    • Page 15: Kinetic Energy
    • Page 18: Potential Energy
    • Page 22: Conservation of Energy

Chapter 2: Electromagnetism
  - Section 2.1: Electric Fields
    • Page 45: Coulomb's Law
    • Page 48: Electric Field Strength
  - Section 2.2: Magnetic Fields
    • Page 55: Magnetic Force
    • Page 58: Electromagnetic Induction
```

#### How LlamaIndex Stores Nodes

LlamaIndex creates a multi-level hierarchy with two types of indexes:

**Level 1: Leaf Nodes (Detailed Index)**

```python
# These are the actual document chunks - stored with full content
Leaf_1a = Node(
    text="Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest, 
          and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity 
          unless acted upon by a net external force. This is the principle 
          of inertia...",
    metadata={'page': 5, 'section': '1.1', 'chapter': 1},
    node_id='leaf_1a'
)

Leaf_1b = Node(
    text="Newton's Second Law: F=ma. The net force on an object equals 
          its mass times acceleration. This fundamental equation allows 
          us to predict motion...",
    metadata={'page': 7, 'section': '1.1', 'chapter': 1},
    node_id='leaf_1b'
)

# ... more leaf nodes for each page
```

**Level 2: Branch Nodes (Summary Index - Coarse)**

```python
# LlamaIndex generates summaries of child nodes
Branch_1_1 = Node(
    text="Summary: This section covers Newton's Three Laws of Motion, 
          explaining inertia, force-mass-acceleration relationship, 
          and action-reaction pairs.",
    children=['leaf_1a', 'leaf_1b', 'leaf_1c'],
    metadata={'section': '1.1', 'chapter': 1},
    node_id='branch_1_1'
)

Branch_1_2 = Node(
    text="Summary: This section discusses energy concepts including 
          kinetic energy, potential energy, and the law of conservation 
          of energy.",
    children=['leaf_1d', 'leaf_1e', 'leaf_1f'],
    metadata={'section': '1.2', 'chapter': 1},
    node_id='branch_1_2'
)
```

**Level 3: Chapter Nodes (Higher-Level Summary)**

```python
Chapter_1 = Node(
    text="Summary: Classical Mechanics chapter covering Newton's Laws, 
          force, motion, energy, and work.",
    children=['branch_1_1', 'branch_1_2'],
    metadata={'chapter': 1},
    node_id='chapter_1'
)

Chapter_2 = Node(
    text="Summary: Electromagnetism chapter covering electric and 
          magnetic fields, Coulomb's Law, and electromagnetic induction.",
    children=['branch_2_1', 'branch_2_2'],
    metadata={'chapter': 2},
    node_id='chapter_2'
)
```

**Level 4: Root Node (Top-Level Summary)**

```python
Root = Node(
    text="Summary: Complete physics textbook covering Classical Mechanics 
          and Electromagnetism with fundamental laws and principles.",
    children=['chapter_1', 'chapter_2'],
    node_id='root'
)
```

Storage Layer:
  • All nodes stored in flat database (docstore)
  • Each node has: text, metadata, children, parent pointers
  • Summaries stored at branch/root level
  • Full content stored at leaf level

#### Query Resolution: Multiple Matching Nodes

**Query Example:** "Explain Newton's Second Law and electromagnetic induction"

This query matches two different branches of the tree.

**Scenario 1: Matching Nodes on Same Path**

Query: "Explain Newton's First and Second Laws"

```
Matching nodes:
  • Branch_1_1 (Newton's Laws) - matches both
  • Leaf_1a (First Law) - matches
  • Leaf_1b (Second Law) - matches

Resolution:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   SAME PATH - Traverse Down             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 1: Start at root, find Chapter 1 matches
Step 2: Drill into Branch_1_1 (Newton's Laws)
Step 3: Since multiple leaves match AND on same path:
        → Retrieve ALL matching leaves [1a, 1b]
Step 4: Synthesize answer from both leaves

Result: Comprehensive answer using BOTH leaf nodes
```

**Scenario 2: Matching Nodes on Different Paths**

Query: "Explain Newton's Second Law and electromagnetic induction"

```
Matching nodes:
  • Branch_1_1 (Newton's Laws) - matches "Second Law"
    └─ Leaf_1b (F=ma)
  • Branch_2_2 (Magnetic Fields) - matches "induction"
    └─ Leaf_2d (Electromagnetic Induction)

Resolution:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   DIFFERENT PATHS - Evaluate Both       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 1: Start at root
Step 2: LLM evaluates: "Which chapters are relevant?"
        → Chapter 1: Relevance score = 0.8
        → Chapter 2: Relevance score = 0.9
Step 3: Explore BOTH chapters (controlled by child_branch_factor)
Step 4: Chapter 1 path:
        - Drill to Branch_1_1 → Retrieve Leaf_1b
Step 5: Chapter 2 path:
        - Drill to Branch_2_2 → Retrieve Leaf_2d
Step 6: Combine results from BOTH paths
Step 7: LLM synthesizes answer using both leaves

Result: Answer covering BOTH topics from different sections
```

#### LlamaIndex Query Algorithm

```python
def query_tree_index(query, root_node, child_branch_factor=1):
    """
    Traverse tree based on relevance
    
    Args:
        child_branch_factor: How many branches to explore at each level
                           1 = single path (greedy)
                           2+ = multiple paths (thorough)
    """
    current_level = [root_node]
    relevant_leaves = []
    
    while current_level:
        # Evaluate all nodes at current level
        scored_nodes = []
        for node in current_level:
            # LLM judges: "Is this node relevant to query?"
            relevance_score = llm.evaluate_relevance(query, node.text)
            scored_nodes.append((node, relevance_score))
        
        # Sort by relevance
        scored_nodes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        # Select top child_branch_factor nodes
        selected = scored_nodes[:child_branch_factor]
        
        # Prepare next level
        next_level = []
        for node, score in selected:
            if node.is_leaf():
                # Reached bottom - this is detailed content
                relevant_leaves.append(node)
            else:
                # Intermediate node - continue traversing
                next_level.extend(node.children)
        
        current_level = next_level
    
    # Synthesize answer from all relevant leaves
    context = "\n\n".join([leaf.text for leaf in relevant_leaves])
    answer = llm.generate_answer(query, context)
    return answer
```

#### Key Insights

**1. Coarse-to-Fine Retrieval:**

```
Coarse (Summary Index): High-level summaries at branch/root
Fine (Detailed Index): Full content at leaf nodes
Query starts coarse, drills down to fine details
```

**2. Same Path Logic:**

```python
if all_matching_nodes_on_same_path:
    # Retrieve all matching leaves on that path
    return [leaf for leaf in path if leaf.matches(query)]
    # Example: "First Law and Second Law" → both from Newton section
```

**3. Different Path Logic:**

```python
if matching_nodes_on_different_paths:
    # Evaluate each path's relevance
    # Explore top K paths (K = child_branch_factor)
    # Collect leaves from multiple paths
    # Synthesize combined answer
    # Example: "Newton's Law and Induction" → two different chapters
```

**4. Efficiency:**

```
Don't read all documents (unlike Summary Index)
Only traverse relevant branches
Good for 1000+ documents with clear hierarchy
```

#### Retrieval with `child_branch_factor` — Visual Walkthrough

The `child_branch_factor` controls **how many children the LLM evaluates and follows at each level** during traversal. It directly affects recall vs. speed.

**Setup: Tree with `num_children=3` (3 children per node)**

```
                         [ROOT]
                       /   |   \
                    /      |      \
               [B1]      [B2]      [B3]
             "Auth"    "Billing"  "Shipping"
             / | \     / | \      / | \
           L1 L2 L3  L4 L5 L6  L7 L8 L9
```

**Query:** "Why is my login failing and my invoice wrong?"
(Spans Auth AND Billing branches)

---

**`child_branch_factor=1` (Greedy — single path)**

```
Step 1: ROOT has 3 children → LLM scores all 3:
          B1 "Auth"     → relevance: 0.85  ← WINNER
          B2 "Billing"  → relevance: 0.80
          B3 "Shipping" → relevance: 0.10
        Pick top 1 → follow B1 only

Step 2: B1 has 3 leaves → LLM scores all 3:
          L1 "Password reset error"  → 0.90  ← WINNER
          L2 "SSO failure"           → 0.70
          L3 "MFA issues"            → 0.40
        Pick top 1 → return L1

Result: Only answers the "login failing" part
        ❌ Completely misses billing/invoice info

LLM calls during retrieval: 2 (one per level)
Leaves retrieved: 1
```

**`child_branch_factor=2` (Balanced — two paths)**

```
Step 1: ROOT has 3 children → LLM scores all 3:
          B1 "Auth"     → relevance: 0.85  ← SELECTED
          B2 "Billing"  → relevance: 0.80  ← SELECTED
          B3 "Shipping" → relevance: 0.10
        Pick top 2 → follow B1 AND B2

Step 2a: B1 has 3 leaves → LLM scores all 3:
          L1 "Password reset error"  → 0.90  ← SELECTED
          L2 "SSO failure"           → 0.70  ← SELECTED
          L3 "MFA issues"            → 0.40
        Pick top 2 → return L1, L2

Step 2b: B2 has 3 leaves → LLM scores all 3:
          L4 "Invoice mismatch"      → 0.88  ← SELECTED
          L5 "Payment gateway error" → 0.60  ← SELECTED
          L6 "Subscription renewal"  → 0.30
        Pick top 2 → return L4, L5

Result: Answers BOTH login AND invoice questions
        ✅ Covers both branches of the query

LLM calls during retrieval: 3 (1 at root + 2 at branch level)
Leaves retrieved: 4
```

**`child_branch_factor=3` (Exhaustive — all paths)**

```
Step 1: ROOT has 3 children → follow ALL 3
        → B1, B2, B3

Step 2: Each branch → pick top 3 leaves (= all leaves)
        → L1-L9 (all 9 leaves)

Result: Maximum recall, but retrieves everything
        ⚠️ Approaches Summary Index behavior (reads all docs)

LLM calls during retrieval: 4 (1 + 3)
Leaves retrieved: 9
```

**Summary: `child_branch_factor` Trade-offs**

```
child_branch_factor    Recall    Speed    LLM Calls    Best For
───────────────────    ──────    ─────    ─────────    ────────────────────

                                                       to miss anything
```

**Code:**

```python
from llama_index.core import TreeIndex

# Build tree
index = TreeIndex.from_documents(
    docs,
    num_children=10,  # Branching factor
    build_tree=True
)

# Query (traverses tree)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    child_branch_factor=2  # How many branches to explore per level
)

# Single path query
response = query_engine.query("What is Newton's Second Law?")
# Traverses: Root → Chapter 1 → Section 1.1 → Leaf (F=ma)

# Multi-path query  
response = query_engine.query("Explain force and electromagnetic induction")
# Traverses: Root → Chapter 1 + Chapter 2 → Multiple sections → Multiple leaves
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Efficient for large collections
- ✅ Natural hierarchical exploration
- ✅ Good for broad → specific queries
- ✅ Preserves relationships

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex to build and maintain
- ❌ Requires good document structure
- ❌ Slower query time vs flat index

**Best For:**
- Large document collections (1000+)
- Hierarchical content (manuals, wikis)
- Multi-level queries
- Exploration and discovery

**When to Use:**
- You have 1000+ documents
- Documents have natural hierarchy
- Users ask broad then narrow down
- Browsing is important

**Real-World Use Cases:**

```
✓ Technical manuals and documentation
  Query: "Explain section 4.2 of the compliance policy"
  Structure: Manual → Chapters → Sections → Paragraphs
  Traverses: Root → Compliance Chapter → Section 4 → 4.2

✓ Legal document analysis
  Query: "What are the liability clauses?"
  Structure: Contract → Articles → Clauses → Sub-clauses
  Traverses: Root → Liability Article → Specific clauses

✓ Enterprise wiki search
  Query: "How does the authentication system work?"
  Structure: Wiki → Categories → Pages → Sections
  Traverses: Root → Engineering → Auth System → Details

✓ Textbook Q&A
  Query: "What is Newton's Second Law?"
  Structure: Textbook → Chapters → Sections → Paragraphs
  Traverses: Root → Physics → Mechanics → Newton's Laws
```

**Scale:** 1000+ documents with natural hierarchy

**Parameters:**

```python
TreeIndex.from_documents(
    docs,
    num_children=10,  # Branching factor (lower = deeper tree)
    build_tree=True,  # Auto-build hierarchy
    use_async=True  # Parallel construction
)
```

### 4. Keyword Table Index

**Description**: Extract keywords from each chunk, match query keywords.

**How It Works:**
```
Document: "Users report authentication failures after password reset"
Keywords: [authentication, failures, password, reset, users]

Query: "auth reset problem"
Keywords: [auth, reset, problem]

Match: auth→authentication ✓, reset✓, problem→failures✓
Score: 3/3 keywords matched
```

#### How Keywords Are Extracted

By default, LlamaIndex uses an **LLM call** to extract keywords:

```python
# LlamaIndex sends each document to the LLM with a prompt like:
"Extract keywords from the following text. Return as comma-separated list:
{document_text}"

# LLM returns: "authentication, password, reset, login, SSO, error"
```

**What gets stored (inverted index):**
```
Keyword → [Document IDs]
─────────────────────────
"password"  → [ticket_1, ticket_5, ticket_12]
"login"     → [ticket_1, ticket_3, ticket_8]
"timeout"   → [ticket_7, ticket_15]
"billing"   → [ticket_20, ticket_25]
```

**At query time:**
1. Extract keywords from query (also via LLM or simple tokenization)
2. Look up matching documents in the keyword table
3. Return documents that share keywords with the query

**Key difference from vector search**: No semantic understanding—"authentication" won't match "login" unless both keywords appear in the same document.

**Code:**
```python
from llama_index.core import KeywordTableIndex

# Build keyword index (uses LLM to extract keywords)
index = KeywordTableIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Query
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("password authentication")
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No embeddings needed (faster, cheaper)
- ✅ Good for keyword-specific queries
- ✅ Exact term matching
- ✅ Works offline (no API calls)

**Cons:**
- ❌ No semantic understanding
- ❌ Misses synonyms ("car" != "vehicle")
- ❌ Poor for natural language queries
- ❌ Sensitive to wording

**Best For:**
- Code search (function names, error codes)
- Technical documentation
- ID/ticket number lookup
- Exact term matching

**When to Use:**
- You have structured data with IDs
- Queries use specific terminology
- Want to avoid embedding costs
- Offline operation needed

**Real-World Use Cases:**
```
✓ Ticket/Issue ID lookup
  Query: "TICK-001" or "JIRA-4532"
  Returns: Exact ticket with that ID

✓ Error code search
  Query: "HTTP 503 error" or "NullPointerException"
  Returns: Docs containing those exact error codes

✓ Code search
  Query: "function parseJSON" or "class UserAuthentication"
  Returns: Files containing those function/class names

✓ API endpoint lookup
  Query: "/api/v2/users/profile"
  Returns: Documentation for that exact endpoint

✓ Product SKU search
  Query: "SKU-78432-BLK"
  Returns: Product catalog entry

Scale: Any size, very fast, no LLM needed for retrieval
```

**Example Use Cases:**
```python
# Good queries for keyword index:
"TICK-001"  # Exact ID
"HTTP 503 error"  # Specific error code
"function parse_json"  # Code identifier

# Poor queries for keyword index:
"How do I fix login issues?"  # Natural language
"Problems with authentication"  # Synonyms
```

### 5. Hybrid Retrieval

**Description**: Combine multiple retrieval strategies for best results.

#### Why Hybrid?

Vector search and keyword search have complementary weaknesses:

| Search Type | Catches | Misses |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Vector** | Semantic matches ("login" ↔ "authentication") | Exact terms (ticket IDs, error codes) |
| **Keyword** | Exact matches ("TICK-001", "HTTP 503") | Synonyms, related concepts |

**Example:**
```
Query: "authentication timeout error TICK-001"

Vector Search finds:
  - "Login session expired after inactivity" (semantic match)
  - "SSO authentication failures" (semantic match)
  - MISSES "TICK-001" (not semantically similar)

Keyword Search finds:
  - "TICK-001: Auth service error" (exact match)
  - "timeout configuration issue" (keyword match)  
  - MISSES "Login session expired" (no keyword overlap)

Hybrid finds ALL of them → fewer missed results
```

**How It Works:**
```
Query: "authentication timeout"

Vector Search:     Keyword Search:
[Doc A: 0.89]      [Doc C: 3 keywords]
[Doc B: 0.85]      [Doc A: 2 keywords]
[Doc C: 0.75]      [Doc E: 1 keyword]

Fusion (RRF - Reciprocal Rank Fusion):
score(doc) = 1/(rank_vector + k) + 1/(rank_keyword + k)

Final Ranking:
[Doc A: 0.032]  # High in both → most confident
[Doc C: 0.029]  # Good in both
[Doc B: 0.015]  # Vector only
```

**Code:**
```python
# Simple hybrid approach
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
keyword_index = KeywordTableIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Retrieve from both
vector_nodes = vector_index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=5).retrieve(query)
keyword_nodes = keyword_index.as_retriever().retrieve(query)

# Combine using RRF
def reciprocal_rank_fusion(results_list, k=60):
    scores = {}
    for results in results_list:
        for rank, node in enumerate(results, 1):
            node_id = node.node_id
            if node_id not in scores:
                scores[node_id] = {'node': node, 'score': 0}
            scores[node_id]['score'] += 1 / (rank + k)
    
    sorted_nodes = sorted(scores.values(), key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
    return [item['node'] for item in sorted_nodes]

# Get final results
hybrid_results = reciprocal_rank_fusion([vector_nodes, keyword_nodes])
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ More robust to query variations
- ✅ Higher accuracy overall
- ✅ Reduces false negatives

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower (runs multiple searches)
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Requires result fusion logic
- ❌ Higher computational cost

**Best For:**
- Production systems
- High-stakes applications
- Diverse query types
- Maximum accuracy required

**When to Use:**
- Accuracy > speed
- Mixed query types (natural + keywords)
- Users vary in query style
- Worth the extra cost

**Real-World Use Cases:**
```
✓ Production customer support
  Query: "auth error TICK-001"
  Vector finds: Related auth troubleshooting articles
  Keyword finds: Exact ticket TICK-001
  Combined: Both the specific ticket AND related solutions

✓ Enterprise search
  Query: "budget meeting Q3 2024"
  Vector finds: Semantically related budget discussions
  Keyword finds: Docs with exact "Q3 2024" mention
  Combined: Comprehensive results across both

✓ E-commerce product search
  Query: "comfortable running shoes size 10"
  Vector finds: Semantically similar athletic footwear
  Keyword finds: Products with exact "size 10" in specs
  Combined: Relevant products in the right size

✓ Medical/Legal search (high stakes)
  Query: "diabetes medication interactions"
  Vector finds: Related drug interaction articles
  Keyword finds: Exact drug names mentioned
  Combined: Can't afford to miss relevant results

Scale: Any size, but 2x retrieval cost
```

**Fusion Strategies:**

**1. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** - Recommended
```python
score = 1/(rank + k) + 1/(rank + k)
# k=60 is a good default
```

**2. Weighted Sum**
```python
score = 0.7 * vector_score + 0.3 * keyword_score
# Tune weights based on your data
```

**3. Cascade**
```python
# Use keyword first, then vector for ties
if keyword_results.has_high_match():
    return keyword_results
else:
    return vector_results
```

## Comparison Matrix

| Strategy | Speed | Accuracy | Scale | Semantic | Exact Match | Cost |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| Vector | Fast | High | Excellent | ✅ | ❌ | Medium |
| Summary | Slow | Medium | Poor | Partial | ❌ | Low |
| Tree | Medium | High | Excellent | ✅ | ❌ | Medium |
| Keyword | Fast | Medium | Good | ❌ | ✅ | Low |
| Hybrid | Slow | Highest | Good | ✅ | ✅ | High |

## Choosing the Right Strategy

### Decision Tree

```
START
  ↓
Do you have < 100 documents?
  ├─ YES → Summary Index
  └─ NO → Continue
       ↓
Do you need exact keyword matching?
  ├─ YES → Keyword or Hybrid
  └─ NO → Continue
       ↓
Do you have 1000+ documents with hierarchy?
  ├─ YES → Tree Index
  └─ NO → Continue
       ↓
Is maximum accuracy critical?
  ├─ YES → Hybrid (Vector + Keyword)
  └─ NO → Vector Index (default)
```

### Use Case Mapping

| Use Case | Recommended Strategy | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Customer Support | Hybrid | Mixed natural + ticket IDs |
| Documentation | Vector or Tree | Semantic understanding needed |
| Code Search | Keyword + Vector | Exact identifiers + concepts |
| Legal/Compliance | Tree | Hierarchical structure |
| Quick Prototype | Vector | Simple, effective |
| FAQ | Summary | Small dataset, full answers |

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Multi-Index Architecture

Use different indexes for different content types:

```python
class MultiIndexRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ticket_index = VectorStoreIndex(...)  # Recent tickets
        self.kb_index = TreeIndex(...)  # Knowledge base
        self.code_index = KeywordTableIndex(...)  # Code docs
    
    def query(self, query):
        # Route based on query type
        if looks_like_ticket_id(query):
            return self.ticket_index.query(query)
        elif is_code_query(query):
            return self.code_index.query(query)
        else:
            # Hybrid across all
            return self.hybrid_query(query)
```

### 2. Dynamic Index Selection

```python
def select_index(query, user_context):
    if user_context.is_admin:
        # Admins get hierarchical browsing
        return tree_index
    elif len(query.split()) < 3:
        # Short queries use keywords
        return keyword_index
    else:
        # Default semantic
        return vector_index
```

### 3. Index Composition

```python
from llama_index.core import ComposableGraph

# Build specialized indexes
auth_index = VectorStoreIndex(auth_docs)
perf_index = VectorStoreIndex(perf_docs)
api_index = KeywordTableIndex(api_docs)

# Compose into graph
graph = ComposableGraph.from_indices(
    TreeIndex,
    [auth_index, perf_index, api_index],
    index_summaries=[
        "Authentication and login issues",
        "Performance and latency problems",
        "API reference and codes"
    ]
)

# Query routes automatically
response = graph.query("How to fix slow API?")
# Routes to: TreeIndex → perf_index OR api_index
```

### 4. Metadata Filtering

Add filters to narrow search:

```python
from llama_index.core.vector_stores import MetadataFilters, ExactMatchFilter

# Create index with metadata
docs = [
    Document(text=text, metadata={
        "category": "authentication",
        "priority": "high",
        "date": "2024-01-15"
    })
]

# Query with filters
filters = MetadataFilters(filters=[
    ExactMatchFilter(key="category", value="authentication"),
    ExactMatchFilter(key="priority", value="high")
])

query_engine = index.as_query_engine(filters=filters)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Index Construction

```python
# Parallel document processing
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
    docs,
    show_progress=True,  # Progress bar
    use_async=True  # Parallel embedding
)

# Batch embedding
from llama_index.core import ServiceContext

service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(
    embed_batch_size=100  # Embed 100 docs at once
)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs, service_context=service_context)
```

### Query Optimization

```python
# Cache query results
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_query(query_text):
    return query_engine.query(query_text)

# Adjust retrieval parameters
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    similarity_top_k=3,  # Fewer chunks = faster
    response_mode="compact"  # Less LLM processing
)
```

### Storage Optimization

```python
# Persist index to disk
index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir="./storage")

# Load from disk (much faster)
from llama_index.core import load_index_from_storage, StorageContext

storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./storage")
index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)
```

## Evaluation

### Retrieval Quality

```python
def evaluate_index(index, test_queries):
    metrics = {
        'precision': [],
        'recall': [],
        'latency': []
    }
    
    for query, relevant_ids in test_queries:
        start = time.time()
        results = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=5).retrieve(query)
        latency = time.time() - start
        
        retrieved_ids = [r.node.metadata['id'] for r in results]
        
        # Precision@K
        relevant_retrieved = len(set(retrieved_ids) & set(relevant_ids))
        precision = relevant_retrieved / len(retrieved_ids)
        
        # Recall
        recall = relevant_retrieved / len(relevant_ids)
        
        metrics['precision'].append(precision)
        metrics['recall'].append(recall)
        metrics['latency'].append(latency)
    
    return {
        'avg_precision': np.mean(metrics['precision']),
        'avg_recall': np.mean(metrics['recall']),
        'avg_latency': np.mean(metrics['latency'])
    }
```

### A/B Testing

```python
# Compare strategies
strategies = {
    'vector': VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs),
    'tree': TreeIndex.from_documents(docs),
    'hybrid': create_hybrid_index(docs)
}

for name, index in strategies.items():
    metrics = evaluate_index(index, test_queries)
    print(f"{name}: P={metrics['avg_precision']:.3f}, "
          f"R={metrics['avg_recall']:.3f}, "
          f"Latency={metrics['avg_latency']:.2f}s")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
```python
# Begin with vector index
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)

# If not working well, try hybrid
if precision < 0.7:
    index = create_hybrid_index(docs)
```

### 2. Match Index to Data
- **Structured docs** (manuals) → Tree Index
- **Unstructured text** (articles) → Vector Index
- **Mixed content** → Hybrid

### 3. Tune Parameters
```python
# Retrieval count
similarity_top_k = 3  # Start here
# If too narrow → increase to 5-7
# If too broad → decrease to 1-2

# Response mode
response_mode = "compact"  # Fastest
response_mode = "tree_summarize"  # Best quality
response_mode = "simple_summarize"  # Middle ground
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# LlamaIndex logs query execution
query_engine.query("test")
# Logs: Retrieved 3 nodes in 0.15s
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Wrong Index for Use Case
❌ Using Summary Index for 1000+ documents (too slow)
✅ Use Tree or Vector Index for scale

### 2. No Metadata
❌ Storing raw text only
✅ Add metadata for filtering and debugging

### 3. Over-Engineering
❌ Starting with complex hybrid system
✅ Begin with Vector Index, optimize as needed

### 4. Ignoring Evaluation
❌ Deploying without testing
✅ Create test queries, measure accuracy

## Integrating LlamaIndex with LangChain

Since we're using LlamaIndex for indexing but LangChain elsewhere, here's how to integrate them seamlessly:

### Basic Integration

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, Document
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Step 1: Build index with LlamaIndex
docs = [Document(text=text, metadata=meta) for text, meta in doc_data]
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Step 2: Convert to LangChain retriever
retriever = index.as_retriever(
    similarity_top_k=3,
    vector_store_query_mode="default"
)

# Step 3: Use in LangChain chain
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True
)

# Step 4: Query
result = qa_chain({"query": "How to fix authentication issues?"})
print(result['result'])
print(f"Sources: {[doc.metadata for doc in result['source_documents']]}")
```

### Advanced Integration: Custom Retriever

```python
from langchain.schema import BaseRetriever, Document as LangChainDoc
from typing import List

class LlamaIndexRetriever(BaseRetriever):
    """Wrap LlamaIndex as LangChain retriever"""
    
    def __init__(self, index, similarity_top_k=3):
        self.index = index
        self.retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=similarity_top_k)
    
    def get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[LangChainDoc]:
        """Retrieve documents using LlamaIndex"""
        nodes = self.retriever.retrieve(query)
        
        # Convert LlamaIndex nodes to LangChain documents
        docs = []
        for node in nodes:
            doc = LangChainDoc(
                page_content=node.text,
                metadata={
                    'score': node.score,
                    'node_id': node.node_id,
                    **node.metadata
                }
            )
            docs.append(doc)
        
        return docs
    
    async def aget_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[LangChainDoc]:
        # Async version
        return self.get_relevant_documents(query)

# Usage
vector_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
retriever = LlamaIndexRetriever(vector_index, similarity_top_k=5)

# Use in any LangChain chain
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True
)
```

### Hybrid: LlamaIndex Indexing + LangChain Chains

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, TreeIndex
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Build multiple indexes with LlamaIndex
vector_idx = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
tree_idx = TreeIndex.from_documents(docs)

# Convert both to retrievers
vector_retriever = vector_idx.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=3)
tree_retriever = tree_idx.as_retriever()

# Custom LangChain chain that uses both
def hybrid_retrieve(query: str):
    # Get from both indexes
    vector_nodes = vector_retriever.retrieve(query)
    tree_nodes = tree_retriever.retrieve(query)
    
    # Combine and deduplicate
    all_nodes = {node.node_id: node for node in vector_nodes + tree_nodes}
    
    # Convert to LangChain format
    return [
        LangChainDoc(page_content=node.text, metadata=node.metadata)
        for node in all_nodes.values()
    ]

# Use in LangChain template
template = """Answer based on these documents:

{context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["context", "question"])
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Query
query = "How to fix authentication?"
docs = hybrid_retrieve(query)
context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
result = chain.run(context=context, question=query)
```

### Using LlamaIndex Query Engine in LangChain Tools

```python
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create LlamaIndex query engines
vector_idx = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
summary_idx = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs)

vector_engine = vector_idx.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)
summary_engine = summary_idx.as_query_engine()

# Wrap as LangChain tools
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Vector Search",
        func=lambda q: str(vector_engine.query(q)),
        description="Search for specific information using semantic similarity. "
                    "Use for targeted questions like 'How to reset password?'"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Summary Search",
        func=lambda q: str(summary_engine.query(q)),
        description="Get high-level summary across all documents. "
                    "Use for broad questions like 'What are common issues?'"
    )
]

# Create agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)

# Agent will choose the right index strategy
response = agent.run("What's the most common authentication issue?")
# Agent chooses "Summary Search"

response = agent.run("How do I fix ticket TICK-001?")
# Agent chooses "Vector Search"
```

### Sharing Vector Stores Between LlamaIndex and LangChain

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.chroma import ChromaVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding
import chromadb

# Initialize shared Chroma DB
chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_db")
chroma_collection = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection("documents")

# Option 1: Build with LlamaIndex, use in LangChain
llama_vector_store = ChromaVectorStore(chroma_collection=chroma_collection)
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=llama_vector_store)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs, storage_context=storage_context)

# Now use the same Chroma DB in LangChain
langchain_vectorstore = Chroma(
    client=chroma_client,
    collection_name="documents",
    embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings()
)
retriever = langchain_vectorstore.as_retriever()

# Option 2: Build with LangChain, use in LlamaIndex
langchain_vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=langchain_docs,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)

# Access same DB from LlamaIndex
chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./chroma_db")
chroma_collection = chroma_client.get_collection("langchain")
llama_vector_store = ChromaVectorStore(chroma_collection=chroma_collection)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(llama_vector_store)
```

### Best Practices for Integration

1. **Choose per use case:**
   - Use **LlamaIndex** for: Indexing, diverse retrieval strategies, complex query engines
   - Use **LangChain** for: Chains, agents, prompt templates, integrations

2. **Share vector stores:**
   - Build index once with either framework
   - Access from both frameworks as needed
   - Saves time and API costs

3. **Convert retrievers:**
   - LlamaIndex → LangChain: Use `index.as_retriever()`
   - Wrap in `BaseRetriever` for full control

4. **Leverage strengths:**
   - LlamaIndex: Better for advanced indexing (Tree, Hybrid, etc.)
   - LangChain: Better for orchestration (agents, chains, memory)

### Complete Example: Production RAG System

```python
# indexing.py - Use LlamaIndex for indexing
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, Document
import os

def build_index(documents):
    """Build and persist index with LlamaIndex"""
    docs = [Document(text=d['text'], metadata=d['metadata']) for d in documents]
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs)
    index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir="./storage")
    return index

# rag_chain.py - Use LangChain for RAG pipeline
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from llama_index.core import load_index_from_storage, StorageContext

def create_rag_chain():
    """Load LlamaIndex and create LangChain pipeline"""
    # Load LlamaIndex index
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./storage")
    index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)
    
    # Convert to LangChain retriever
    retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=3)
    
    # Build LangChain chain
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
        llm=llm,
        retriever=retriever,
        return_source_documents=True,
        chain_type_kwargs={
            "prompt": CUSTOM_PROMPT  # Your custom prompt
        }
    )
    
    return qa_chain

# main.py - Use both
index = build_index(my_documents)  # LlamaIndex indexing
qa = create_rag_chain()  # LangChain pipeline
result = qa({"query": "How do I fix auth issues?"})
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **LlamaIndex and LangChain are complementary**, not competitive
2. **Easy integration** via retrievers and vector stores
3. **Choose the right tool** for each part of your pipeline
4. **This workshop**: LlamaIndex for Module 3 indexing, LangChain for everything else
5. **Production**: Mix and match based on your needs

You now have the knowledge to use both frameworks together effectively!

## Next Steps

Now that you understand indexing strategies and how to integrate LlamaIndex with LangChain, proceed to **Module 4: RAG Pipeline** to learn how to combine retrieval with generation for complete question-answering systems.
